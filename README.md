## Tic Tac Toe

### Overview

An enhanced version of the tic-tac-toe game developed in Java. This is a console game.

When the game starts, you'll see the game configuration and an empty board.

During the game, human players will be prompted to enter the coordinates position where they want to place their mark. The position should be entered in this format: `row,column`, where the row and column values range from 0 to N-1, and N is the board size. If the position is invalid or occupied, you'll be prompted again until you enter a valid position.

Computer AI moves will be done automatically on its turn, and you will see the board updated with the selected position. The AI, for now, is a simple random class.

The game can finish in two possibilities:

1. There is a winner (a row, column, or diagonal line) as in normal tic-tac-toe. In a 3x3 board, it's 3 symbols, and in a 10x10 board, it's 5 symbols.
2. All the positions have been filled, and the board is full.

To play the game, you need to run the Java program and follow the prompts.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe
